task: Implement Guard MCP client updates
goal: |
  Implement the MCP client SDK changes to support X-Tenant-Id / X-User-Id header auth,
  update client API, examples/templates, and tests per plan. Work independently and in parallel when possible.
constraints:
  - Do not create documentation unless explicitly requested by user.
  - Prefer existing repo conventions; inspect current code before editing.
  - Avoid touching unrelated files.
  - Use apply_patch for single-file edits where practical.
  - Keep ASCII-only unless file already uses Unicode.
targets:
  - Update GuardMCPClient to accept tenant_id and user_id, with header precedence rules.
  - Support both header modes: X-Tenant-Id (+ optional X-User-Id) or Authorization Bearer.
  - Add/adjust MCP config templates/examples to show tenant header usage.
  - Add/adjust tests to cover tenant header auth and API key auth.
steps:
  - Discover existing guard_mcp_client package and examples/tests.
  - Implement header construction logic with clear precedence (tenant headers override API key when set).
  - Ensure connection uses constructed headers for MCP session initialization.
  - Update or add examples/templates in repo to demonstrate both auth modes.
  - Update or add integration tests as feasible without requiring external services.
deliverables:
  - Code changes in guard_mcp_client package.
  - Example/config template updates if present in repo.
  - Tests updated/added to validate behavior.
report_back:
  - Summarize changes with file paths.
  - Call out any assumptions or open questions.
